It is a simple REST API built using Flask that manages user data with CRUD operations.

The API supports the following routes:

GET /users → Retrieve all users

GET /users/<id> → Retrieve a specific user

POST /users → Add a new user

PUT /users/<id> → Update user details

DELETE /users/<id> → Delete a user


User data is stored in an in-memory dictionary, and the API can be tested using Postman or Curl.
This task demonstrates the fundamentals of REST API development using Flask and Python.
